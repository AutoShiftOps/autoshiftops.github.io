When a container fails in production, you don’t always have time to browse StackOverflow. You need a checklist.

This post is a field guide for the three most common container "murders": Memory (OOMKilled), CPU Throttling, and I/O Saturation. We’ll diagnose each using the `docker stats` + Linux host tools workflow we established last week.

## Scenario 1: The "Silent" Death (OOMKilled)
Symptom: The container restarts randomly. No error logs in the application output because it was killed instantly by the kernel.

### 1. Confirm it was an OOM Kill
Docker knows why the container died. Ask it:

```bash
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.State.OOMKilled}}'
# Output: true
```

Or check the specific exit code (137 = 128 + 9 SIGKILL):

```bash
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.State.ExitCode}}'
# Output: 137
```

### 2. Find the "Smoking Gun" in Kernel Logs
If Docker confirms it, see exactly when the kernel snapped. Run this on the host:

```bash
dmesg -T | grep -i "killed process"
```

You’ll see a line like: `Out of memory: Killed process 1234 (node) total-vm:2048kB, anon-rss:1024kB`.

### 3. The Fix
- **Immediate:** Bump the memory limit if the host has capacity.

    ```bash
    docker update --memory 2g <container>
    ```

- **Root Cause:** Check your application for memory leaks. If it’s Java, check the heap settings (`-Xmx`). If it’s Node, check the GC behavior.

## Scenario 2: The "Slow" Death (CPU Throttling)
Symptom: App is running but incredibly slow. Latency spikes. Health checks time out.
​
### 1. Check if it’s throttling
Linux cgroups enforce CPU limits by "pausing" your process when it uses its quota. It doesn’t kill the app; it just freezes it for milliseconds at a time.

Check `docker stats` first:

```bash
docker stats --no-stream
```

If `CPU %` is consistently near 100% of your configured limit (e.g., if you gave it 0.5 CPUs and it’s at 50%), you are being throttled.

### 2. Verify Throttling in cgroups
Look at the raw cgroup metrics (works on cgroup v1/v2):

```bash
# Find the container ID
docker inspect <container> --format '{{.Id}}'

# Check throttle stats (path varies by distro, commonly:)
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/docker/<long-id>/cpu.stat
```

Look for `nr_throttled` and `throttled_time`. If these numbers are rising, your app is gasping for air.
​
### 3. The Fix
- **Remove the limit** temporarily to prove it’s the bottleneck.

    ```bash
    docker update --cpus 0 <container>
    ```

- **Tune requests:** If the app needs that CPU, increase the limit. If it’s a bug (infinite loop), profile the app.
​
## Scenario 3: The "Gridlock" (Disk I/O Saturation)
Symptom: The container becomes unresponsive, `docker ps` hangs, or logs stop writing.
​
### 1. Identify the I/O Hog
Is it the container or the neighbor?

```bash
# Check host I/O
iostat -x 1 5
```

If `%util` is >80%, the disk is saturated.

### 2. Blame the Container
Use `pidstat` (part of `sysstat`) to find which process is thrashing the disk:

```bash
pidstat -d 1
```

Look for the PID with high `kB_rd/s` or `kB_wr/s`. Match that PID back to a container:

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' <container>
```

### 3. The Fix
- **Limit the blast radius:** Set a Block I/O limit on the greedy container so it doesn’t kill the host.

    ```bash
    docker update --blkio-weight 100 <container>  # Low priority (default 500)
    ```

- **Move logs:** Ensure your app isn’t logging debug data to the container’s JSON log driver (which writes to disk). Use a log shipper or write to `stdout` sparingly.
​

## Bonus: Network Connectivity Issues
**Symptom:** "Connection refused" or timeouts between containers.

### 1. The "Can I reach it?" Check
Don't guess. Enter the container’s namespace:

```bash
docker exec -it <source-container> sh
# Inside:
ping <target-container-name>
nc -zv <target-container-name> <port>
```

### 2. If DNS fails
Docker has its own internal DNS. Check `/etc/resolv.conf` inside the container:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

It should point to Docker’s embedded DNS server (usually `127.0.0.11`). If it’s missing or wrong, check your daemon config.
​
## Summary Checklist (Copy/Paste)
| Symptom | Check Command | Fix Action |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Random Restarts | `docker inspect <container> --format '{{.State.OOMKilled}}'` | Increase RAM limit / Fix memory leak |
| Sluggish App | `cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/docker/<id>/cpu.stat` (check `nr_throttled`) | Increase CPU limit / Profile app |
| Host Unresponsive | `iostat -x 1 5` & `pidstat -d 1` | Limit Block I/O weight / Reduce logging |
| Network Timeout | `docker exec <container> nc -zv <target> <port>` | Check Docker DNS / Verify network aliases |

## Next Steps
Now that you can debug containers manually, how do you automate this? Next week, we’ll build a "Self-Healing" Bash Script that detects these states and alerts you automatically.
