When migrating from an on-premises Hadoop cluster to Amazon EMR on EC2, it is crucial to ask the right questions to ensure a smooth transition. Here are some critical questions to consider:

## 1. Current On-Premises Setup

- What is the current Hadoop distribution (Cloudera, Hortonworks, Apache Hadoop, etc.) and version?

- How many nodes are in the on-prem cluster, and what are their configurations (CPU, RAM, Storage)?

- What services (HDFS, YARN, Hive, HBase, Spark, etc.) are currently in use?

- Are there any custom configurations or optimizations in the on-prem setup?

## 2. Data Migration

- What is the total data size to be migrated from on-prem to EMR?

- Is the data static or continuously generated (streaming data)?

Are there any sensitive data that require encryption during transit and at rest?

- What is the most suitable data transfer method (AWS Direct Connect, AWS DataSync, S3 Transfer Acceleration, Snowball, etc.)?

- Are there any data partitioning and compression strategies that need to be applied during migration?

## 3. Security and Access Control

- How is user authentication and authorization managed on the on-prem cluster (Kerberos, LDAP, Ranger, Sentry)?

- What are the existing IAM roles and policies for accessing Hadoop services?

- How will access control be managed in EMR (IAM roles, security groups, AWS KMS for encryption)?

- Are there any existing network security configurations (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups) needed for EMR?

## 4. Network Configuration

- Should EMR be launched in a VPC with public or private subnets?

- What is the preferred network configuration (NAT Gateway, VPC Peering, Direct Connect)?

- Are there any network performance requirements (latency, bandwidth)?

## 5. Storage Management

- Where will the data be stored in AWS (S3, EBS, or HDFS on EMR)?

- What are the retention policies for S3 data (lifecycle policies, versioning, intelligent tiering)?

- Are there any requirements for data backup and disaster recovery?

## 6. Cluster Configuration

- What will be the EMR cluster type (transient, long-running, or serverless)?

- What instance types and sizes should be used for master, core, and task nodes?

- Should EMR be configured with Auto Scaling?

- Are there any custom AMIs or bootstrap actions required?

## 7. Application and Workload Migration

- What are the existing applications running on Hadoop (Spark, Hive, HBase, Pig, Flink)?

- Are there any custom scripts, UDFs, or libraries that need to be migrated?

- Are the applications compatible with the EMR version being considered?

- Are there any SLAs or performance benchmarks that must be met on EMR?

## 8. Cost Optimization

- What are the expected EMR costs, including EC2, S3, and data transfer?

- Are Spot Instances suitable for any part of the workload?

- Can Reserved Instances be used for predictable workloads?

- Are there any cost optimization tools (AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets) in use?

## 9. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- How will the EMR cluster be monitored (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, EMR Metrics)?

- What are the logging configurations for EMR (CloudWatch Logs, S3 logging)?

- How will alerts be configured for critical failures?

## 10. Post-Migration Validation and Testing

- What are the acceptance criteria for successful migration (data integrity, performance, security)?

- How will migrated jobs and applications be tested on EMR?

- Are there any rollback strategies in case of migration failure?
