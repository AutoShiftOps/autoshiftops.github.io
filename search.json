    "content": "Running Large Language Models on CPU: A Practical Guide to CPU-Only LLM Inference  No GPUs. No cloud scaling. Just Linux, CPUs, and solid systems engineering.Large Language Models (LLMs) are often associated with expensive GPUs and cloud infrastructure. However, for development, research, privacy-sensitive environments, and cost-controlled setups, running LLMs entirely on CPU is not only possible — it’s practical.This post is a complete, end-to-end guide to running large models (13B–27B+) on CPU-only hardware, using modern quantization techniques and efficient runtimes like llama.cpp.By the end, you’ll understand:  Why CPU-based LLMs exist  What quantization and inference really mean  How to set up a Linux system for CPU inference  How large models can realistically run without GPUs  A reproducible workflow you can use immediatelyWhy Run LLMs on CPU?Let’s address the obvious question first.If GPUs are faster, why bother with CPU?Because speed is not the only constraint.CPU-based LLMs are ideal when you need:  Low-cost experimentation (no $10K GPUs)  Offline or air-gapped environments  Privacy &amp; compliance (healthcare, finance, legal)  On-prem developer tooling  Edge or internal R&amp;D systems  Predictable, reproducible environmentsFor many teams, “fast enough” beats “fastest possible.”Core Concepts (No ML Background Required)1. What Is Inference?Inference is the act of using a trained model to generate text.  Training = learning weights (expensive, GPU-heavy)  Inference = reading weights + predicting tokens (much cheaper)This guide is only about inference.2. Why Large Models Don’t Fit on CPU (By Default)A 27B model in FP16 format:  27B parameters × 2 bytes ≈ 54 GB RAMThat’s before runtime overhead.This is why quantization exists.Quantization Explained (Simply)What Is Quantization?Quantization reduces the precision of model weights to save memory and speed up inference.

    "content": "🚀 AI-Powered Stock Trading Bot in Python (With Backtesting)A practical, end-to-end guide to building an AI-driven stock trading bot using Python, LSTM models, and backtesting.📌 IntroductionAlgorithmic trading is no longer reserved for hedge funds. With Python, open APIs, and modern AI models, individual engineers can build intelligent stock trading bots that analyze data, predict price movement, backtest strategies, and automate trades.In this post, I’ll walk you through:  Designing an AI agent for stock price prediction  Converting predictions into trading decisions  Backtesting the strategy on historical data  Preparing the system for real-world deploymentThis guide is hands-on, practical, and written for:  Software / DevOps engineers  Python developers  Anyone curious about AI in finance🧠 What Is an AI Trading Agent?An AI trading agent is a system that:  Observes the market (historical &amp; live data)  Learns patterns using machine learning  Makes decisions (Buy / Sell / Hold)  Executes trades automatically  Improves through evaluation and backtestingCore Components| Component          | Purpose                                     || —————— | ——————————————- || Data Source        | Market prices (Yahoo Finance, Alpaca, etc.) || AI Model           | Predict future price movement               || Strategy Engine    | Convert predictions into actions            || Backtesting Engine | Validate strategy on past data              || Broker API         | Execute trades                              |🏗️ System ArchitectureMarket Data → AI Model → Trading Strategy → Backtesting → Broker APIThis separation keeps the system modular, testable, and scalable.📊 Step 1: Fetching Stock Market DataWe’ll use Yahoo Finance for historical prices.import yfinance as yfimport pandas as pdticker = \"AAPL\"df = yf.download(ticker, start=\"2020-01-01\", end=\"2024-01-01\")df = df[['Close']]df.dropna(inplace=True)This gives us clean, daily closing prices — perfect for modeling.🤖 Step 2: AI Model (LSTM for Time-Series Prediction)Stock prices are sequential data, so LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) works well.Why LSTM?  Learns temporal patterns  Handles noisy financial data better than simple regression  Widely used in quantitative finance researchfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequentialfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropoutfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScalerimport numpy as npData Preparationscaler = MinMaxScaler()scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df)def create_sequences(data, window=50):    X, y = [], []    for i in range(len(data) - window):        X.append(data[i:i+window])        y.append(data[i+window])    return np.array(X), np.array(y)X, y = create_sequences(scaled)🧪 Step 3: Training the Modelmodel = Sequential([    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(50,1)),    Dropout(0.2),    LSTM(50),    Dense(1)])model.compile(optimizer=\"adam\", loss=\"mse\")model.fit(X, y, epochs=20, batch_size=32)This model predicts the next-day closing price.📈 Step 4: Designing the Trading StrategyPredictions alone are useless without rules.Simple Strategy Logic            Condition      Action                  Predicted price &gt; current + 2%      BUY              Predicted price &lt; current - 2%      SELL              Otherwise      HOLD      This avoids over-trading and reduces noise.🔁 Step 5: Backtesting the StrategyBacktesting answers one question:  Note — “Would this strategy have worked in the past?”      Use a strict train/validation split and avoid look‑ahead or data leakage.    Account for transaction costs, commissions, slippage, and bid/ask spreads.    Simulate realistic order sizes, partial fills, and market hours/liquidity.    Validate with walk‑forward and out‑of‑sample testing, not just in‑sample fit.    Report performance metrics: CAGR, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, drawdown duration, and win rate.    Stress test across different market regimes and perform sensitivity analysis.    Paper‑trade after backtesting before any live deployment.  Backtesting Enginedef backtest(df, model, initial_cash=10000):  cash = initial_cash  position = 0  trades = []   for i in range(50, len(df)):    window = df.iloc[i-50:i]    X = scaler.transform(window).reshape(1,50,1)    predicted = scaler.inverse_transform(model.predict(X))[0][0]    price = df.iloc[i]['Close']        if predicted &gt; price * 1.02 and cash &gt;= price:      cash -= price      position += 1      trades.append((\"BUY\", price))        elif predicted &lt; price * 0.98 and position &gt; 0:      cash += price      position -= 1      trades.append((\"SELL\", price))      final_value = cash + position * df.iloc[-1]['Close']  return final_value, trades📊 Step 6: Performance EvaluationAI Strategy vs Buy &amp; Holdfinal_value, trades = backtest(df, model)buy_hold = 10000 * (df.iloc[-1]['Close'] / df.iloc[0]['Close'])print(\"AI Strategy:\", final_value)print(\"Buy &amp; Hold:\", buy_hold)This comparison tells you whether the AI adds real value or just noise.⚠️ Important Risk ConsiderationsAI trading is not magic.Be aware of:  Overfitting  Market regime changes  Latency in real trading  Slippage and transaction feesNever deploy without:  Backtesting  Paper trading  Risk limits  Stop-loss rules🚀 Production Readiness ChecklistBefore going live:✅ Paper trading (Alpaca)✅ Daily trade limits✅ Stop-loss &amp; take-profit✅ Logging &amp; monitoring✅ Model retraining strategy🧩 Where This Can Go Next  Reinforcement Learning (RL)  Multi-stock portfolio optimization  Sentiment analysis (news + social)  Kubernetes-based trading microservices  Fully autonomous AI agents🧠 Final ThoughtsAI-powered trading bots are an excellent real-world application of machine learning, combining:  Data engineering  AI modeling  System design  Financial reasoningEven if you never trade real money, building one will level up your skills dramatically.⚠️ Disclaimer  This article is for educational purposes only.It is not financial advice.Always understand the risks before trading.✍️ About the AuthorI’m a DevOps Engineer exploring the intersection of AI, automation, and real-world systems.I write about practical AI, engineering, and building systems that actually work."

    "content": "Getting Started with GitHub Automation: Supercharge Your WorkflowIn today’s fast-paced tech world, efficiency is everything. Whether you’re a developer, DevOps engineer, or tech enthusiast, automating repetitive tasks is a game-changer. Enter GitHub Automation—your key to smarter workflows, faster deployments, and less manual grunt work.In this post, we’ll explore what GitHub Automation is, why it matters, and how you can get started—even if you’re new to the ecosystem.🔹 What is GitHub Automation?GitHub Automation refers to the use of GitHub Actions, bots, and scripts to perform routine tasks automatically. Think of it as giving your repository superpowers. Tasks like:      Running tests every time you push code        Automatically deploying your app        Sending notifications for pull requests or issues        Merging branches under certain conditions  …can all happen without you lifting a finger.It’s like having a personal assistant for your code!🔹 Why You Should CareHere’s why automation isn’t just a “nice-to-have,” but a must in 2025:      Time Saver – Stop repeating manual tasks. Spend your brainpower on creative and critical work.        Error Reduction – Machines don’t forget steps. Your tests, deployments, and merges become more reliable.        Consistency – Automation ensures your workflow is standard across all projects and team members.        Scalability – Your project grows, your automation grows with it. No additional overhead.  🔹 Meet GitHub ActionsAt the heart of GitHub Automation is GitHub Actions. It allows you to define “workflows” triggered by specific events in your repository.      Event Triggers – Push, pull request, issue creation, scheduled cron jobs, and more.        Jobs &amp; Steps – Each workflow consists of jobs (parallel tasks) and steps (individual commands).        Marketplace – Pre-built actions for everything: code linting, deployments, notifications, security checks, and even AI-assisted tasks!  Example: Automatically run tests on every push to the main branch and deploy to your staging server.🔹 Getting Started: Step-by-StepHere’s a simple roadmap to kickstart your GitHub Automation journey:1️⃣ Identify Repetitive TasksLook for tasks that are routine and error-prone:      Testing code        Generating documentation        Deploying builds        Code formatting  2️⃣ Create Your First Workflow      Navigate to your repo → Actions tab → New workflow.        Start with a template or from scratch. For example:  name: CI Workflowon: [push]jobs:  build:    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    steps:      - uses: actions/checkout@v3      - name: Run Tests        run: npm test  Save → Commit → Watch it run automatically on your next push.3️⃣ Explore Pre-built ActionsGitHub Marketplace has thousands of ready-made actions:Deployment actions (AWS, Azure, Firebase)Linting &amp; formatting (ESLint, Prettier)Notifications (Slack, Discord, Email)4️⃣ Iterate &amp; ImproveAutomation is a journey. Monitor workflow logs, optimize steps, and gradually automate more processes.🔹 Pro Tips for Maximum Impact      Start Small: Automate one task at a time; avoid overwhelming your workflow.        Use Secrets: Store credentials securely with GitHub Secrets.        Version Control Your Workflows: Keep your .github/workflows folder under version control.        Monitor &amp; Alert: Use notifications to catch workflow failures instantly.  🔹 Final ThoughtsGitHub Automation is no longer optional—it’s essential. It turns your code repository into a smart, self-operating engine that saves time, reduces errors, and empowers creativity.Whether you’re a solo developer or leading a large team, automation lets you focus on innovation, not repetition.💡 Pro Tip: Start experimenting today with GitHub Actions, and in a month, you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it!⚡ Call to ActionIf you found this helpful, share this post with your network, and start automating one workflow today!Also, comment below:“What’s the first task you’ll automate in your GitHub repo?”Let’s build smarter, faster, and more fun workflows together! 🚀"

Here’s how you can build the same—using just code and a handful of connected tools.🛠️ Key Tools &amp; Roles            Tool      Purpose      What I Use It For                  GitHub Actions      CI/CD, Automation      Test, build, deploy              Terraform      IaC      Cloud provisioning              Ansible      Config Management      Server setup/config              ArgoCD      GitOps Deployments      K8s sync, rollbacks              Prometheus      Metrics      Alerting, monitoring              Grafana      Visualization      Dashboards, analysis      Why Automation Matters Now More Than EverSoftware delivery has changed. No longer is it enough to simply write great code; you have to deliver fast, safely, and with confidence. Modern automation tools move us from brittle manual handoffs to predictable, repeatable workflows. This isn’t just about saving time—it’s about empowering teams and restoring focus for real innovation.The Pipeline: A Visual JourneyAbove, you’ll find the heart of every successful engineering org in 2025—a DevOps pipeline that transforms how code becomes customer value. The arrows show how each automation handoff (testing, provisioning, configuring, deploying, monitoring) makes life easier for developers and ops teams alike.Let’s walk through each stage and the tools that make it work.1. Code CommitEvery great product starts with a commit. Developers push changes to their repo, the source of truth.  Key Tools: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket2. CI/CD AutomationContinuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) takes over. Testing, building, and deployment become automatic upon commit.  Key Tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI  Why: Immediate feedback, faster releases, fewer mistakesjobs:    build:        steps:            - name: Checkout code              uses: actions/checkout@v3            - name: Run tests              run: npm test            - name: Build container              run: docker build -t app .3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)Servers, networks, and cloud resources are provisioned by code—no more manual setups, just reusable scripts.  Key Tools: Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation  Why: Scalability, repeatability, version control for infrastructureresource \"aws_instance\" \"web\" {    ami = \"ami-123\"    instance_type = \"t2.micro\"}4. Configuration ManagementYour freshly-provisioned servers need software, users, configs, and application code. Automation tools ensure they’re properly set up every single time.  Key Tools: Ansible, Chef, Puppet  Why: Consistency, no snowflake servers, security best practiceshosts: webtasks:    name: Install NGINX    apt:        name: nginx        state: present5. ContainerizationApps run inside containers for portability and reliability across dev, test, and production.  Key Tools: Docker, Podman  Why: “Works anywhere” deployments, lightweight infrastructure6. Automated DeploymentsOrchestration tools handle rollout, scaling, health checks, and rollbacks—no human intervention needed.  Key Tools: Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Spinnaker  Why: Zero-downtime updates, GitOps workflows, easy rollback7. Production MonitoringFinally, you want visibility into production: performance, errors, user experience. Monitoring and dashboards close the loop, driving faster recovery and data-driven improvements.  Key Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog  Why: Early warning, metrics for success, incident responseThe Power of Connected ToolsEach tool alone is powerful, but connecting them delivers synergy:  Automation replaces mental overhead with creative engineering.  IaC ensures resources are ready, every time.  Config management gives confidence in every deployment.  Containers and orchestration open up scalability.  Monitoring empowers teams to get ahead of problems, not just react.  Note  This pipeline is not theoretical—it’s my real workflow. Over time, I’ve adapted, swapped, and improved tools to fit changing needs. The logos and flow illustrate real handoffs and challenges solved.  Use this as a blueprint, inspiration, or diagnostic for your own DevOps journey. Every org is unique, but the principles are universal.Common Pitfalls &amp; Pro Tips  Don’t neglect monitoring! Bad things happen fast.  Keep configs and infra in version control. Track changes.  Automate rollbacks. Nothing saves you faster.  Invest in documentation and sharing learnings.  Start small—automate one part, then grow.Get Involved  Comment: What does your pipeline look like?  Share: Where do you want to improve?

    "content": "When migrating from an on-premises Hadoop cluster to Amazon EMR on EC2, it is crucial to ask the right questions to ensure a smooth transition. Here’s a comprehensive checklist of critical considerations:1. Current On-Premises Setup  Distribution: What is the current Hadoop distribution (Cloudera, Hortonworks, Apache Hadoop) and version?  Infrastructure:          Number of nodes in the cluster      Node configurations (CPU, RAM, Storage)        Services: Which components are in use? (HDFS, YARN, Hive, HBase, Spark)  Customizations: Any custom configurations or optimizations?2. Data Migration      What is the total data size to be migrated from on-prem to EMR?        Is the data static or continuously generated (streaming data)?  Are there any sensitive data that require encryption during transit and at rest?      What is the most suitable data transfer method (AWS Direct Connect, AWS DataSync, S3 Transfer Acceleration, Snowball, etc.)?        Are there any data partitioning and compression strategies that need to be applied during migration?  3. Security and Access Control      How is user authentication and authorization managed on the on-prem cluster (Kerberos, LDAP, Ranger, Sentry)?        What are the existing IAM roles and policies for accessing Hadoop services?        How will access control be managed in EMR (IAM roles, security groups, AWS KMS for encryption)?        Are there any existing network security configurations (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups) needed for EMR?  4. Network Configuration      Should EMR be launched in a VPC with public or private subnets?        What is the preferred network configuration (NAT Gateway, VPC Peering, Direct Connect)?        Are there any network performance requirements (latency, bandwidth)?  5. Storage Management      Where will the data be stored in AWS (S3, EBS, or HDFS on EMR)?        What are the retention policies for S3 data (lifecycle policies, versioning, intelligent tiering)?        Are there any requirements for data backup and disaster recovery?  6. Cluster Configuration      What will be the EMR cluster type (transient, long-running, or serverless)?        What instance types and sizes should be used for master, core, and task nodes?        Should EMR be configured with Auto Scaling?        Are there any custom AMIs or bootstrap actions required?  7. Application and Workload Migration      What are the existing applications running on Hadoop (Spark, Hive, HBase, Pig, Flink)?        Are there any custom scripts, UDFs, or libraries that need to be migrated?        Are the applications compatible with the EMR version being considered?        Are there any SLAs or performance benchmarks that must be met on EMR?  8. Cost Optimization      What are the expected EMR costs, including EC2, S3, and data transfer?        Are Spot Instances suitable for any part of the workload?        Can Reserved Instances be used for predictable workloads?        Are there any cost optimization tools (AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets) in use?  9. Monitoring and Troubleshooting      How will the EMR cluster be monitored (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, EMR Metrics)?        What are the logging configurations for EMR (CloudWatch Logs, S3 logging)?        How will alerts be configured for critical failures?  10. Post-Migration Validation and Testing  Acceptance Criteria:          Data integrity validation      Performance benchmarks      Security compliance checks        Testing Strategy:          Job migration validation      Application functionality testing      Performance testing        Rollback Plan:          Fallback procedures      Data recovery strategy      Service continuity plan        Pro Tip: Start with a small proof-of-concept migration before attempting the full production workload migration.Additional Resources  AWS EMR Migration Guide  EMR Best Practices  Migration Cost Calculator"
